- `[IfMax]`

Added extension method `bool IsNullableNumber(this Type)`.

# [4.1.1](https://github.com/gregsdennis/json-everything/pull/670)

Add support for multiple `[If]` attributes for the same property under the same group creating an `enum` keyword with all of the values.

# [4.1.0](https://github.com/gregsdennis/json-everything/pull/670) {#release-schemagen-4.1.0}

[#667](https://github.com/gregsdennis/json-everything/issues/667) - Add support for `description` keyword creation from XML comments `<Summary>`.  Thanks to [@zlepper](https://github.com/zlepper) for applying pressure on this feature.

Updated for multi-framework support with .Net Standard 2.0 and .Net 8, including updating _System.Text.Json_ from v6 to v8.

AOT support is not currently supported for this library.  Appropriate attributes have been added to public API.

## Breaking changes

- Dropping support for .Net Standard 3.1 - May still be used, but exact behavior cannot be guaranteed. 
- `PropertyNamingMethods` removed.  Previously marked obsolete.
- `SchemaGenerationConfiguration.PropertyNamingMethod` removed.  Previously marked obsolete.

# [3.5.0](https://github.com/gregsdennis/json-everything/pull/581) {#release-schemagen-3.5.0}

[#579](https://github.com/gregsdennis/json-everything/issues/579) - Types which contained properties with both nullable and non-nullable versions of the same value type would attribute all properties as nullable.  Thanks to [@tjochums](https://github.com/tjochums) for reporting.

Also fixed a hash code collision issue with property ordering.

# [3.5.0](https://github.com/gregsdennis/json-everything/pull/557) {#release-schemagen-3.5.0}

[#548](https://github.com/gregsdennis/json-everything/issues/551) - Add `[Default]` attribute to generate `default` keyword.

# [3.4.2](https://github.com/gregsdennis/json-everything/pull/553) {#release-schemagen-3.4.2}

[#551](https://github.com/gregsdennis/json-everything/issues/551) - Strings implement `IEnumerable<T>` and thus were considered arrays.  As a result `minItems` and `maxItems` were being applied.  Thanks to [@domchlouba](https://github.com/domchlouba) for reporting this and recommending the fix.

# [3.4.1](https://github.com/gregsdennis/json-everything/pull/546) {#release-schemagen-3.4.1}

[#544](https://github.com/gregsdennis/json-everything/issues/544) - Objects that have two properties of the same type, one of which is marked with an `[Obsolete]` attribute will cause all properties to have a `deprecated: true` added to their schemas.  Thanks to [@filzrev](https://github.com/filzrev) for reporting this.

Also affected by this were `[JsonPropertyName]` and `[JsonIgnore]`.

# [3.4.0](https://github.com/gregsdennis/json-everything/pull/529) {#release-schemagen-3.4.0}

[#528](https://github.com/gregsdennis/json-everything/pull/528) - [@juwens](https://github.com/juwens) suggesting adding `PropertyNameResolver` for property naming that takes the entire `MemberInfo` (instead of just the member name) in place of `PropertyNamingMethod` so that additional information can be used to determine a name for the JSON property.

`SchemaGenerationConfiguration.PropertyNamingMethod` has been deprecated.  It's still functional but will be removed with the next major version.

# [3.3.2](https://github.com/gregsdennis/json-everything/pull/513) {#release-schemagen-3.3.2}

[#512](https://github.com/gregsdennis/json-everything/issues/512) - There was no support for `JsonNode`, explicitly.  Instead it would attempt to generate via reflection.  This update adds that support and just generates a `true` schema.  Thanks to [@ashek-simeon](https://github.com/ashek-simeon) for reporting and recommending a solution.

# [3.3.1](https://github.com/gregsdennis/json-everything/pull/491) {#release-schemagen-3.3.1}

[#488](https://github.com/gregsdennis/json-everything/issues/488) - `[Maximum(double.MaxValue)]` throws an overflow exception when attempting to convert to decimal.  This fix updates all min/max-related attributes.

Added conditional schema generation using new attributes to define condition groups and then assigning other attributes to those groups.

# [3.2.0](https://github.com/gregsdennis/json-everything/pull/456) {#release-schemagen-3.2.0}

[#455](https://github.com/gregsdennis/json-everything/issues/455) - Better naming for `$defs` keys.

Also added `ITypeNameGenerator` and `SchemaGenerationContextOptimizer.TypeNameGenerator` to allow custom naming.

# [3.1.1](https://github.com/gregsdennis/json-everything/pull/454) {#release-schemagen-3.1.1}

[#450](https://github.com/gregsdennis/json-everything/issues/450) - Fixed an edge case issue where a recursive class structure defining the same property type caused a stack overflow when the outer class property was decorated with `[Nullable]`.

# 3.1.0 (no PR) {#release-schemagen-3.1.0}

Updated JsonSchema.Net reference to v4.0.0.

# [3.0.3](https://github.com/gregsdennis/json-everything/pull/327) {#release-schemagen-3.0.3}

[#325](https://github.com/gregsdennis/json-everything/issues/325) - [@jnystad](https://github.com/jnystad) found an issue with `[Nullable]` where it was propagating to other properties of the same type and suggested a fix.

# [3.0.2](https://github.com/gregsdennis/json-everything/pull/301) {#release-schemagen-3.0.2}

[#296](https://github.com/gregsdennis/json-everything/pull/296) - Updated handling logic for `[JsonIgnore]` to consider the attribute's `Condition` property.

# 3.0.1 (no PR) {#release-schemagen-3.0.1}

[#288](https://github.com/gregsdennis/json-everything/issues/288) - Just bumping version to pick up the latest Json.More.Net by default.  This package pull Json.More.Net transitively via JsonPointer.Net which wasn't updated with the move to `JsonNode`.

# [3.0.0](https://github.com/gregsdennis/json-everything/pull/280) {#release-schemagen-3.0.0}

Updated all functionality to use `JsonNode` instead of `JsonElement` in line with JsonSchema.Net v3.

## Breaking Changes {#release-schemagen-3.0.0-breaks}

_`JsonElement` -> `JsonNode` type exchange changes not listed._

- `IContextContainer.GetContexts()` and implementations removed as it was obsolete
- `TypeExtensions.IsInteger()`, `.IsFloatingPoint()`, and `.IsNumber()` moved to Json.More.Net

# [2.1.1](https://github.com/gregsdennis/json-everything/pull/275) {#release-schemagen-2.1.1}

[#274](https://github.com/gregsdennis/json-everything/issues/274) - Added support for `JsonObject`, `JsonArray`, and `JsonValue`.

# [2.2.0](https://github.com/gregsdennis/json-everything/pull/273) {#release-schemagen-2.2.0}

[#272](https://github.com/gregsdennis/json-everything/issues/272) - Miscellaneous attributes can cause incorrect optimizations.

Added `SchemaGeneratorConfiguration.Optimize` to control whether common subschemas are collected into `$defs`.

Exposed `SchemaGeneratorConfiguration.Current` static property for read use by custom generators, etc.

# [2.1.0](https://github.com/gregsdennis/json-everything/pull/267) {#release-schemagen-2.1.0}

[#264](https://github.com/gregsdennis/json-everything/issues/264) - Added support for `additionalProperties` and `additionalItems`.

Improved support for array types that inherit `IEnumerable<T>` but aren't generic themselves, e.g. `MyList : List<int>`.

Also updated return value of `SchemaGenerationContextBase.Apply()` from `JsonSchemaBuilder` to `JsonSchema`.  This is pretty hidden, so it _shouldn't_ break anyone, thus not strictly adhering to semver for this change.  Calling it out just in case.

# 2.0.1 (No PR) {#release-schemagen-2.0.1}

Exposed `SchemaGenerationContextBase.Hash` property.  Required to implement `IContextContainer.Replace()`.

Marked `IContextContainer.GetContexts()` obsolete as it's not used.

# [2.0.0](https://github.com/gregsdennis/json-everything/pull/261) {#release-schemagen-2.0.0}

[#202](https://github.com/gregsdennis/json-everything/issues/202) - Added support for read-only & write-only keywords for properties that only have getters or setters.  The attributes override this detection behavior.

[#256](https://github.com/gregsdennis/json-everything/pull/256) - Added support for type-level attributes.

## Breaking changes {#release-schemagen-2.0.0-breaks}

- Intents no longer require equality methods (`Equals()` & `GetHashCode()`). 🎉
- `SchemaGeneratorContext` replaced by `SchemaGenerationContextBase`, `TypeGenerationContext`, and `MemberGenerationContext`.
    - The "Type" version represents generation of a "pure" type; that is, it's not a member of another type.  This will only handle attributes that are placed on the type itself.
    - The "Member" version represents object members.  This will handle attributes placed on the member.  The `Attributes` property is only present on this version since the type carries the attributes for the other.
- `SchemaGenerationContextCache.Get()` has two overloads, only with member attributes, and one without.  If attributes are supplied, a `MemberGenerationContext` will be returned; otherwise a `TypeGenerationContext` will be returned.
- `SchemaGeneratorConfiguration` converted into a thread-static singleton (the static property is `Current`) for easier access.
- `IAttributeHandler` is now just a placeholder.  Attribute handlers will now need to implement `IAttributeHandler<T>` where `T` is the attribute type.
- `IAttributeHandler.AddConstraints()` now has an `attribute` parameter.

## Other fixes & enhancements {#release-schemagen-2.0.0-other}

- Added `Nullability`.
- Added `SchemaGenerationConfiguration.Nullability`.

[#125](https://github.com/gregsdennis/json-everything/pull/125) - Bug fix: generation of object with no serializable properties still generates an empty `properties` keyword.

Also updated intent classes to be mutable.  Should have been this way to begin with, but was probably an oversight.
